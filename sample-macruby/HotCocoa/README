This directory contains a few demos of using the HotCocoa library.

To learn more about HotCocoa see:

  http://www.macruby.org/trac/wiki/HotCocoa
  
Part of HotCocoa installs a hotcocoa command which generates a
project directory from a template.

Usage:

hotcocoa <directory>

This will generate your directory structure.  The samples in this
directory were generated with this command.  The basic HotCocoa
directory structure is:

./directory/Rakefile              #=> used with macrake to build the app
./directory/config/build.yml      #=> build options
./directory/lib/application.rb    #=> application template
./directory/lib/menu.rb           #=> menus used by the app
./resources/HotCocoa.icns         #=> hotcocoa icon 

After generating the structure, cd into that directory and run 
macrake to build.

Demos:

calculator    #=> simple calculator example
demo          #=> demo of many hotcocoa wrappers
layout_view   #=> demo of using the layout view system

Building the demos:

Calculator:
$ cd calculator
$ macrake

Demo:
$ cd demo
$ macrake

Layout View:
$ cd layout_view
$ macrake
