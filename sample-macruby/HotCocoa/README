== HotCocoa Examples ==

This directory contains a few demos of using the HotCocoa library.

To learn more about HotCocoa see:

  http://www.macruby.org/trac/wiki/HotCocoa
  
Part of HotCocoa installs a hotcocoa command which generates a
project directory from a template.

Usage:

hotcocoa <directory>

This will generate your directory structure.  The samples in this
directory were generated with this command.  The basic HotCocoa
directory structure is:

./directory/Rakefile              #=> used with macrake to build the app
./directory/config/build.yml      #=> build options
./directory/lib/application.rb    #=> application template
./directory/lib/menu.rb           #=> menus used by the app
./resources/HotCocoa.icns         #=> hotcocoa icon 

After generating the structure, cd into that directory and run 
macrake to build.

== Examples ==

calculator: a simple calculator example.

demo: demo of many hotcocoa wrappers.

layout_view: demo of using the layout view system.

round_transparent_window: port of an Apple sample showing how to use hotcocoa 
with a nib files.

round_transparent_window_no_nibs: same as round_transparent_window but without
using any nibs.

download_and_progress_indicator: demo of downloading data, progress indicator
and scroll view containing a text view.

Building the examples:

$ cd <example-directory>
$ macrake

== HotCocoa::Graphics Examples ==

$ cd graphics
$ open -a textedit README
