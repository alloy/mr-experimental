=== HotCocoa::Graphics Examples ===

You will find in this directory several examples that illustrate the 
graphics layer of HotCocoa.

You can run them from the command line using macruby. 

  $ macruby particle.rb

You should then see an image opening in your default image viewer.

These examples are drawing into PNG images, but it is possible to draw on
any CoreGraphics context, for example within an NSView's drawRect: method.

== TODO ==

Write a demo HotCocoa app that embeds all the samples and draw in an NSView.
